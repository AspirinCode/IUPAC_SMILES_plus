* Created derivative of OpenSMILES Document, IUPAC SMILES+ Specification
Working Draft.

* Updated formatting of opensmiles asciidoc*
The opensmiles.asciidoc was not rendering correctly in GitHub and Atom asciidoc
preview. So, I fixed a variety of asciidoc syntax issues including: headings,
removing open blocks, and table formatting (they must have symmetric number
of '=' to begin and close tables). I did not make any changes to the
OpenSMILES specification.
